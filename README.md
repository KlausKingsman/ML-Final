### Abstract
In our Machine Learning Project, we will be exploring a variety of different machine learning 
solutions to well-established datasets from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC). Specifically, we will be examining the domain of malware where we will classify a malignant or benign program as well as defining what category of malware of the program if it is malicious. The preferred dataset that we will be using for these tasks is the CICMalMem-2022 made and provided by CIC. Methodology will be done by testing the machine learning algorithms to first classify a binary classification task (Benign vs. Malignant) before we test the machine learning models on classifying the types of malwares (Ransomware, Trojan, Spyware, vs. Benign). The goal with this project is to determine the performance of each model, and determine the champion model that performed the best from the sought-out tasks.
